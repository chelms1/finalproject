			<h3>How we met</h3>

			<p class="theHow">On a cold January night we met through mutual friends. We were young at the time and quickly fell for each other.
			We grew through our teenage years together and now into our early twenties. We learned a lot about life and a lot about
			each other through the seven years (so far) that we have spent together.There have been much shared laughter, sarcasm, puns, crying, and yelling.  
			There was a lot to learn and quite frankly was an interesting way to grow up.  </p><br>
			
			<p class="theHow"> There were times where we made each other better and unfortunately 
			times where we made each other worse, but those times made us mature and see the flaws we otherwise might overlook.  It's been an interesting journey
			so far going to Sporting Kc games,  Painting, Gaming (or watching Taylor game at times) , and overall building our life together. Besides it's not everyday 
			that you get to spend the rest of your life with your high school sweetheart.</p><br>
			
			<img class="imageProp"src="proposal.jpg" title="Proposal" alt="Proposal">
			<h3>The Proposal</h3>

			<p class="theHow">The proposal was a magical moment. Quite literally. On our vacation to beautiful Florida we went about hanging out on 
			the beach and visiting the different Disney Theme parks. On August 4th in front of the Magic Castle we stopped to plan out 
			what we were going to do at Disney world. We were standing on the bridge as I looked over the at the water. I feel a tap on 
			my back as I turn around to see Taylor. He takes a knee and popped the question.</p><br>

			<p class="theHow">We've been together so long and discussed 
			this but it was nothing to it actually happening. Taylor confessed how nerve racking it was for him. For me I was surprised
			and scared. Everyone who knows me knows I'm shy so it wont surprise anyone that I was completely shocked and didn't know what
			to expect. Of course I said yes and had to repeat that for family members to hear but that was the day I agreed to Marry the love of my life. </p>

			<p class="detailP">We are getting married October 8th 2016. We wanted a date that in some way represented us.
			The idea with 10/08/16 is two people will go from two individuals (10-2=8) and combining (8x2=16).</p><br>
			
			<h3 class="detailh3">The Where</h3>
			<p class="detailP">We are getting married at the beautiful Prariefire Museum. This venue is gorgeous with colourful stained glass and timeless historical

			<p>Of the 8 years we've been together we've been rather notoriously bad at taking photos. We are dedicating this event in our lives
			to make sure it will be well remembered. We are encouraging everyone to send in pictures of themselves or us to help us commemorate this
			happy day in our lives.</p>

			<p>If you prefer to do things 'old school' feel free to mail us any pictures or contact us about receiving them. For the social wave we are asking
			you use the 'hashtag' #C&TBurdineWedding on any pictures you would like to share with us. After the big day we will be collaborating all pictures into
			both physical and digital photo books.</p>

			<p>If you are unable to join us we hope you will share your pictures and enjoy the photos streaming in to celebrate with us from afar.</p>
