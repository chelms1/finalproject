			<h3>How we met</h3>

			<p class="theHow">On a cold January night we met through mutual friends. We were young at the time and quickly fell for each other.
			We grew through our teenage years together and now into our early twenties. We learned a lot about life and a lot about
			each other through the seven years (so far) that we have spent together.There have been much shared laughter, sarcasm, puns, crying, and yelling.  
			There was a lot to learn and quite frankly was an interesting way to grow up.  </p><br>
			
			<p class="theHow"> There were times where we made each other better and unfortunately 
			times where we made each other worse, but those times made us mature and see the flaws we otherwise might overlook.  It's been an interesting journey
			so far going to Sporting Kc games,  Painting, Gaming (or watching Taylor game at times) , and overall building our life together. Besides it's not everyday 
			that you get to spend the rest of your life with your high school sweetheart.</p><br>

			<h3>The Proposal</h3>

			<p class="theHow">The proposal was a magical moment. Quite literally. On our vacation to beautiful Florida we went about hanging out on 
			the beach and visiting the different Disney Theme parks. On August 4th in front of the Magic Castle we stopped to plan out 
			what we were going to do at Disney world. We were standing on the bridge as I looked over the at the water. I feel a tap on 
			my back as I turn around to see Taylor. He takes a knee and popped the question.</p><br>
			
			<img class="imageProp" src="TheRing.jpg" title="Proposal" alt="Proposal">

			<p class="theHow">We've been together so long and discussed 
			this but it was nothing to it actually happening. Taylor confessed how nerve racking it was for him. For me I was surprised
			and scared. Everyone who knows me knows I'm shy so it wont surprise anyone that I was completely shocked and didn't know what
			to expect. Of course I said yes and had to repeat that for family members to hear but that was the day I agreed to Marry the love of my life. <br><br>

			<h3 class="detailh3">The Where</h3>
			<p class="detailP">We are getting married at the beautiful Prariefire Museum. This venue is gorgeous with colourful stained glass and timeless historical
